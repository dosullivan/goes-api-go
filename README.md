# goes-api-go

## Description
A lightweight and fast API for retrieving [GOES satellite data](https://www.goes-r.gov/) stored in an S3 bucket, written in Go. This service is designed to be used in conjunction with goes-web, a lightweight web frontend for viewing GOES satellite data.

## Motivation
Basically just wanted to have an easier API to use than the S3 API with a frontend react app.

## Requirements
This service assumes that you have an S3 bucket that is filled with GOES satellite data, likely from [goesrecv](https://pietern.github.io/goestools/commands/goesrecv.html), a system for capturing and processing the satellite data locally. It assumes that you have the same directory structure as the data folder used by `goesproc` as it's writing data. Basically, this implies using some cron script to simply copy the data from the data folder used by `goesproc` (e.g. goes16) to an S3 bucket.

This project was developed against minio and digital ocean spaces, but should work with any S3-compatible storage.

## Configuration
The following environment variables are required:
- `ACCESS_KEY_ID` - The access key for the S3 bucket.
- `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - The secret access key for the S3 bucket.
- `S3_ENDPOINT` - The endpoint for the S3 API.
- `BUCKET_NAME` - The name of the S3 bucket.
- `USE_SSL_FOR_S3` - Whether to use SSL for S3. Set to `false` to use with simple local minio setups.
- `TRUSTED_PROXIES`- A comma-separated list of trusted proxies, in case you want to set them. This isn't used for anything yet.

## API Usage
The following API endpoints are available:
- `/latest` - Returns the latest image available. Example:
```shell
> curl http://localhost:3000/latest
{ "latest": "2024-08-23" }
```
- `/available-dates` - Returns a list of dates with available images. Example:
```shell
> curl http://localhost:3000/available-dates
{ "availableDates": ["2024-08-23", "2024-08-22", "2024-08-21"] }
```
- `/archive/{date}` - Returns the image urls for a given date.Example:
```shell
> curl http://localhost:3000/archive/2024-05-16
{
  "imageUrls": [
    "http://localhost:9000/goes-16/false-color/fd/2024-05-16/OR_ABI-L2-CMIPF-M6CFC_G16_s20241371130206_e20241371139514_c20241371139566.png",
    "http://localhost:9000/goes-16/false-color/fd/2024-05-16/OR_ABI-L2-CMIPF-M6CFC_G16_s20241371200206_e20241371209514_c20241371209572.png",

  ]
}
```

## Deployment
(to be written)

## Development
This repo uses [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to manage environment variables for development. The .envrc file is a sample with default values. It's setup to pick up overriding values from `.envrc.local` if it exists. You can copy the `.envrc` file to `.envrc.local` and modify it to your needs. The `.envrc.local` file is ignored by git.

Likewise, a sample `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for running the server in a container locally. You can copy this file to `docker-compose.override.yml` and modify it to your needs. The `docker-compose.override.yml` file is ignored by git.

To start the server in development mode, just run `make run`. This will start the server on port 3000.

To test your docker compose setup, run `make local-build-deploy`.

## improvements for the future:
- EMWIN and NWS text retrieval?
